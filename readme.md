# Optimized Genshin Pulling

I have a love-hate relationship with Genshin Impact. I love some characters and parts of its gameplay, but
I absolutely hate the gacha system that it has. Therefore, I'm going to try to find the best time to make a
gacha pull so that my wallet and bank balance doesn't approach zero any time soon.

## Data Used

I'm not going to be making a kajillion pulls just to find the optimum time. I'm not rich enough to do that.
Instead, I'm going to be using the data collected from [here](https://github.com/OneBST/GI_gacha_dataset).
